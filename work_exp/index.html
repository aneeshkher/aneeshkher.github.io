	<p style="font-size: 1.5em; line-height: 28pt"><b>A brief summary of my work experience</b></p>
	
	<p>
		I worked at <a class="text-link" href="https://www.broadcom.com" target="_blank">Broadcom Corporation</a> as a Technical Intern in the 
		Network Software tools team. I worked full time in the Summer of 2015 and continued to work part time along with coursework from August 2015 to May 
		2016. 
		My work was mainly focused on developing and reafctoring scripts which were used in the Continuous Integration (CI) framework for the network switch 
		software delivery.

			Work summary at Broadcom:<br>
			<b>Loction:</b> Durham, NC<br>
			<b>Duration:</b> June 2015 - May 2016<br>
			<b>Technologies:</b> Perl, JIRA, ClearQuest, ClearCase, MySQL, HTML, CSS, Electric Commander
		</div>
		
		<ul class="work_ex_text">
			<li style="margin: 5px; padding: 3px">
				Refactored and migrated existing CI scripts to use new JIRA Module instead of legacy ClearQuest API code, in an attempt 
				to reduce dependency on ClearQuest.
			</li>
			<li style="margin: 5px; padding: 3px">
				Developed a file dependency graph generation tool which maps all calling files to the called scripts located anywhere under one directory. 
				This helped the tools team in resolving dependencies and made migration easier.
			</li>
			<li style="margin: 5px; padding: 3px">
				Developed a JIRA Module in Perl which will interact with the internal JIRA server to create, edit, and retrieve issues from the server using 
				REST 
				APIs based on a very flexible search criteria supplied by the calling program.
			</li>
			<li style="margin: 5px; padding: 3px">
				Extended functionality of existing CI script to parse and extract more data in test automation run log file, and generate a CSV file of the 
				same. This provided much better memory metric information (CPU Usage, memory usage, free space, etc) of the device under test. 
			</li>
			<li style="margin: 5px; padding: 3px">
				Fixed an internal switch tool. The tool was written to query all the switches at the Durham location, and retrieve information about them. It 
				would 
				crash and not provide any information if any switch was offline. I fixed this by ensuring that it does not crash, and provides the information 
				of the switches that are online.
			</li>
			<li style="margin: 5px; padding: 3px">
				Fixed CI Perl CGI scripts to provide better switch metric information. Wrote stored procedures in MySQL, which were called by the CI scripts
				to retrieve information from the CI database.
			</li>

		Prior to working at Broadcom, I worked at <a class="text-link" href="http://www.gslab.com" target="_blank">GS Lab Pvt. Ltd.</a> for two years as an 
		automation engineer. 
		My work was mainly focused on developing scripts to improve test coverage, along with fixing and maintenance of the existing scripts for 
		virtual infrastructure automation.

				Developed an automation tool which improved the firewall policy test coverage four fold. Achieved this by adding more network 
				attributes 
				to be covered (IP Address, Port number, Protocol). Improved test coverage by adding test cases spanning multiple additional scenarios 
				(multiple conditions in one rule, multiple rules under single policy).
