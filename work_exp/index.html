<p>A brief summary of my work experience</p>

<p>
	I am currently working part time at <a href="https://www.broadcom.com">Broadcom Corporation</a> as a Technical Intern in the Network Software tools team. 
	I worked full time in the Summer of 2015 and continued to work part time along with coursework after the semester began. My work is mainly focused 
	on developing and reactoring scripts which are used in the Continuous Integration framework for the network switch software delivery.

		Work summary at Broadcom:<br>
		<b>Loction:</b> Durham, NC<br>
		<b>Duration:</b> Summer, 2015 - Present<br>
		<b>Technologies:</b> Perl, JIRA, ClearQuest, ClearCase, MySQL, HTML, CSS, Electric Commander.
	</div>
	
	<ul class="para_text">
		<li style="margin: 5px;">
			Currently working on refactoring existing CI scripts to use new JIRA Module instead of legacy ClearQuest API code, in an attempt 
			to reduce dependency on ClearQuest.
		</li>
		<li style="margin: 5px;">
			Developed a JIRA Module in Perl which will interact with the internal JIRA server to create, edit, and retrieve issues from the server using REST 
			APIs based on a very flexible search criteria supplied by the calling program.
		</li>
		<li style="margin: 5px;">
			Extended functionality of existing CI script to parse and extract more data in test automation run log file, and generate a CSV file of the same. This provided much better memory metric information (CPU Usage, memory usage, free space, etc) of the device under test. 
		</li>
		<li style="margin: 5px;">
			Fixed an internal switch tool. The tool was written to query all the switches at the Durham location, and retrieve information about them. It would 
			crash and not provide any information if any switch was offline. I fixed this by ensuring that it does not crash, and provides the information 
			of the switches that are online.
		</li>
		<li style="margin: 5px";>
			Fixed CI Perl CGI scripts to provide better switch metric information. Wrote stored procedures in MySQL, which were called by the CI scripts
			 to retrieve information from the CI database.
		</li>
	</ul>

<p>
	Prior to working at Broadcom, I worked at <a href="http://www.gslab.com">GS Lab Pvt. Ltd.</a> for two years as an automation engineer. My work was mainly 
	focused on developing scripts to improve test coverage, along with fixing and maintenance of the existing scripts for virtual infrastructure automation.

	<ul class="para_text">
		<li style="margin: 5px;">
			Developed an automation tool which improved the firewall policy test coverage by more than 400%. Achieved this by adding more network attributes 
			to be covered (IP Address, Port number, Protocol). Improved test coverage by adding test cases spanning multiple additional scenarios 
			(multiple conditions in one rule, multiple rules under single policy).
		</li>
		<li style="margin: 5px;">
			Fixed and maintained over 20K lines of virtual infrastructure automation code on a continuous basis. Added functionality to support new releases.
