	<h1>Hello! I'm Aneesh.</h1>
	<p>I live in Raleigh, NC where I'm a graduate Computer Science student at <a href="https://www.ncsu.edu">NC State University</a>.</p>
	<p>After my Bachelor's in Electronics and Telecommunication from University of Pune in 2012, I worked for two years as a 
		Software Engineer at <a href="http://www.gslab.com">GS Lab Pvt. Ltd.</a>, where I was involved in virtual infrastructure automation and firewall 
		test coverage. However, I always wanted to experience a life away from home for a while, and so I left the comfortable life at Pune and 
		enrolled for a <a href="https://www.csc.ncsu.edu/"> Master's program in Computer Science</a> at NC State.</p>
	<p>I am currently working as a Technical Co-op intern at <a href="https://www.broadcom.com">Broadcom Corporation</a>, where I am deeply 
		involved with CI process automation in Perl. I enjoy working with tools and automating software tasks. My long term goal is to work as a 
		software engineer where I can make a significant impact to the software delivery process through automation.
	<p>In my free time, I like to play sports (Squash, Soccer, Cricket, Ping Pong, Raquetball etc.) and watch sitcoms. I am an avid follower 
		of <a href="http://www.friends-tv.org/">Friends</a>, and I watch it during my best and worst times. I won't call myself a technology enthusiast, but I am 
		always intrigued and fascinated by the new discoveries (and the existing ones, of course!) in computer science. I'm also a foodie who would probably hold back on 
		buying that big and fast car just because I'd like to spend that money on trying out a new restaurant. Unfortunately, my love for food hasn't been 
		strong enough to bless me with good cooking skills. I'm working on that!</p>

	<p>Feel free to reach out to me.</p?
