	<h1 class="text-header-h1">Hello! I'm Aneesh.</h1>
	<p>
		I live in Germantown, MD and I'm working as a Software Engineer at <a class="text-link" href="http://www.hughes.com/" target="_blank"> Hughes Network
		Systems</a>.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		After my Bachelor's in Electronics and Telecommunication from University of Pune in 2012, I worked for two years as a 
		Software Engineer at <a class="text-link" href="http://www.gslab.com" target="_blank">GS Lab Pvt. Ltd.</a>. However, I always wanted to experience a
		life away from home for a while, and so I left the comfortable setting at Pune and enrolled for a <a class="text-link" href="https://www.csc.ncsu.edu/"
		target="_blank"> Master's program in Computer Science</a> at NC State.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		During the summer of 2015, I worked as a Technical Intern at <a class="text-link" href="https://www.broadcom.com" target="_blank">Broadcom 
		Corporation at Durham, NC</a>, where I was writing <a class="text-link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_integration" target="_blank">CI
		</a> automation tools in Perl. I continued to work as a part time co-op intern through the next two semesters. I started working at Hughes Network Systems shortly after my graduation.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		In my free time, I like to play sports (Racquetball, Soccer, Badminton, etc.) and watch sitcoms. I am an avid follower 
		of <a class="text-link" href="http://www.friends-tv.org/" target="_blank">Friends</a>, and I watch it during my best and worst times. I won't call
		myself a technology enthusiast, but I am always intrigued and fascinated by the new discoveries (and the existing ones, of course!) in computer
		science. I'm also a foodie who would probably hold back on buying that big and fast car just because I'd like to spend that money on trying out
		various new restaurants. Unfortunately, my love for food hasn't been strong enough to bless me with good cooking skills. I'm working on that!
