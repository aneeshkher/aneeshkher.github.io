	<h1 class="text-header-h1">Hello! I'm Aneesh.</h1>
	<p>
		I live in Germantown, MD and I'm working as a Software Engineer at <a class="text-link" href="http://www.hughes.com/" target="_blank"> Hughes Network
		Systems</a>.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		After my Bachelor's in Electronics and Telecommunication from University of Pune in 2012, I worked for two years as a 
		Software Engineer at <a class="text-link" href="http://www.gslab.com" target="_blank">GS Lab Pvt. Ltd.</a>. However, I always wanted to experience a
		life away from home for a while, and so I left the comfortable setting at Pune and enrolled for a <a class="text-link" href="https://www.csc.ncsu.edu/"
		target="_blank"> Master's program in Computer Science</a> at NC State.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		I worked as a Technical Co-op intern at <a class="text-link" href="https://www.broadcom.com" target="_blank">Broadcom Corporation</a>, where I was
		deeply involved with <a class="text-link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_integration" target="_blank">CI</a> tool automation in Perl. I
		enjoy working with tools and automating software tasks. My long term goal is to work as a software engineer where I can make a significant impact to
		the software delivery process through automation.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		In my free time, I like to play sports (Squash, Soccer, Cricket, Ping Pong, Raquetball etc.) and watch sitcoms. I am an avid follower 
		of <a class="text-link" href="http://www.friends-tv.org/" target="_blank">Friends</a>, and I watch it during my best and worst times. I won't call
		myself a technology enthusiast, but I am always intrigued and fascinated by the new discoveries (and the existing ones, of course!) in computer
		science. I'm also a foodie who would probably hold back on buying that big and fast car just because I'd like to spend that money on trying out
		various new restaurants. Unfortunately, my love for food hasn't been strong enough to bless me with good cooking skills. I'm working on that!
