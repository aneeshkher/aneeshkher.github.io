	<h1 class="header">Hello! I'm Aneesh.</h1>
	<p class="para_gen">I live in Raleigh, NC where I'm a graduate Computer Science student at <a class="res" href="https://www.ncsu.edu">
		NC State University</a>.</p>
	<p class="para_gen">After my Bachelor's in Electronics and Telecommunication from University of Pune in 2012, I worked for two years as a 
		Software Engineer at <a class="res" href="http://www.gslab.com">GS Lab Pvt. Ltd.</a>, where I was involved in virtual infrastructure 
		automation and firewall test coverage. However, I always wanted to experience a life away from home for a while, and so I left the comfortable life 
		at Pune and enrolled for a <a class="res" href="https://www.csc.ncsu.edu/"> Master's program in Computer Science</a> at NC State.</p>
	<p class="para_gen">I am currently working as a Technical Co-op intern at <a class="res" href="https://www.broadcom.com">Broadcom Corporation</a>, where 
		I am deeply involved with CI process automation in Perl. I enjoy working with tools and automating software tasks. My long term goal is to work as a 
		software engineer where I can make a significant impact to the software delivery process through automation.
	<p class="para_gen">In my free time, I like to play sports (Squash, Soccer, Cricket, Ping Pong, Raquetball etc.) and watch sitcoms. I am an avid follower 
		of <a class="res" href="http://www.friends-tv.org/">Friends</a>, and I watch it during my best and worst times. I won't call myself a 
		technology enthusiast, but I am always intrigued and fascinated by the new discoveries (and the existing ones, of course!) in computer science. 
		I'm also a foodie who would probably hold back on buying that big and fast car just because I'd like to spend that money on trying out various 
		new restaurants. Unfortunately, my love for food hasn't been strong enough to bless me with good cooking skills. I'm working on that!</p>
	<p class="para_gen">Feel free to reach out to me.</p>
